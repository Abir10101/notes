**Fundamentals:**

* **OSI Model and TCP/IP:** The OSI model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the different layers of network communication, while TCP/IP is the suite of protocols that govern most internet communication. You should be able to explain each layer's function and how they interact.
* **IP Addressing and Subnetting:** You should be comfortable with IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, including subnetting and CIDR notation. This is essential for allocating IP addresses to various resources within your infrastructure.
* **Routing and Switching:** Understand how routers and switches work to forward traffic within and between networks. Familiarity with routing protocols (like BGP and OSPF) and switching concepts (like VLANs) is also beneficial.
* **DNS:** The Domain Name System is critical for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses. You should know how DNS works and be able to troubleshoot common DNS issues.
* **Load Balancing:** Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance. You should understand different load balancing algorithms and how to configure them.
* **Firewalls and Security:** Network security is paramount. You should be familiar with firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other security measures to protect your infrastructure.
* **Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting:** You'll need to monitor network performance and identify and resolve issues quickly. Tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `tcpdump`, and network monitoring systems will be indispensable.
* **Cloud Networking:** If you're working with cloud providers, you'll need to understand their specific networking offerings, such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), security groups, and load balancers.
* **Container Networking:** With the increasing adoption of containers, you should know how container networking solutions (like Docker networking or Kubernetes networking) work.

**Additional Concepts:**

* **Network Protocols:** In addition to TCP and IP, familiarity with other common protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, and SNMP) is helpful.
* **Network Performance Optimization:** Understanding techniques for optimizing network performance, such as reducing latency and improving throughput, can be valuable.
* **Network Automation:** The ability to automate network configuration and management using tools like Ansible or Terraform is a sought-after skill.
