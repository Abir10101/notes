### **DevOps Networking Concepts Assessment**

#### **Section A: IP Addressing and Subnetting**

1. **[IP Addressing]**  
   Your team has been allocated the IP address block `192.168.10.0/24`. You need to create 4 subnets, each with an equal number of IP addresses.  
   a) Calculate the subnet mask and range of IP addresses for each subnet.  
   b) Which subnet would you assign to a network segment that has 25 hosts?

2. **[Subnetting]**  
   You're configuring a new server with the IP `10.0.1.10/28`.  
   a) Identify the network address, broadcast address, and the range of usable IPs for this subnet.  
   b) Explain how you would configure this subnet in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS VPC or Azure VNet).

#### **Section B: DNS and DHCP**

3. **[DNS Configuration]**  
   You are tasked with configuring DNS for a new domain `example.com`.  
   a) Explain how you would set up the DNS records (A, CNAME, MX) to route traffic to your web server and mail server.  
   b) If the web serverâ€™s IP changes frequently, how would you configure DNS to minimize downtime?

4. **[DHCP Setup]**  
   Your company is setting up a new office with 200 workstations.  
   a) Explain how you would configure the DHCP server to allocate IP addresses automatically.  
   b) How would you ensure critical servers always get the same IP addresses from DHCP?

#### **Section C: NAT and Firewalls**

5. **[NAT Implementation]**  
   You need to configure NAT for a private network `192.168.1.0/24` to access the internet through a public IP `203.0.113.1`.  
   a) Describe the steps to configure this using a typical router or firewall interface.  
   b) How would you implement NAT in a cloud environment, such as AWS?

6. **[Firewall Rules]**  
   You are securing an application that runs on a web server using port 443 (HTTPS) and a database server using port 3306 (MySQL).  
   a) Explain how you would configure firewall rules to allow traffic only between these two servers and clients from a specific IP range `203.0.113.0/24`.  
   b) How would you verify that the firewall rules are working as intended?

#### **Section D: Load Balancing and Proxy Servers**

7. **[Load Balancer Configuration]**  
   Your web application needs high availability, so you decide to use a load balancer.  
   a) Describe how you would configure a Layer 7 load balancer to distribute traffic between two web servers.  
   b) If one server goes down, explain how the load balancer should respond, and how you would configure health checks.

8. **[Proxy Server Setup]**  
   You are setting up a reverse proxy to route traffic to different backend services based on the URL path.  
   a) Describe how you would configure a reverse proxy to route `/api` to `api.example.com` and `/app` to `app.example.com`.  
   b) How would you secure the reverse proxy with SSL/TLS certificates?

---

#### **Section E: VPN and Secure Access**

9. **[VPN Configuration]**  
   Your team needs to securely access an internal network from remote locations.  
   a) Explain how you would set up an IPsec VPN to allow remote access to the internal network.  
   b) What steps would you take to ensure that the VPN is secure and cannot be easily compromised?

10. **[SSH Access Management]**  
    You need to provide SSH access to multiple servers for your DevOps team.  
    a) Describe how you would manage SSH keys to ensure secure and easy access for team members.  
    b) How would you set up SSH tunneling to securely connect to a database server that is only accessible from within the network?

---

#### **Section F: Containers and Cloud Networking**

11. **[Docker Networking]**  
    You are deploying a containerized application using Docker.  
    a) Explain the difference between bridge, host, and overlay network modes in Docker.  
    b) Provide an example of when you would use each mode, and how you would configure it.

12. **[Cloud Networking]**  
    You need to set up a secure network environment for a multi-tier application in AWS.  
    a) Describe how you would configure a VPC with public and private subnets to host a web server, application server, and database server.  
    b) How would you implement security groups and network ACLs to control traffic between the servers and the internet?

---

#### **Section G: Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

13. **[Network Monitoring]**  
    Your application experiences occasional network slowdowns.  
    a) Describe how you would set up network monitoring to identify the cause of the slowdowns.  
    b) Which tools would you use to analyze network traffic, and what specific metrics would you monitor?

14. **[Troubleshooting Network Issues]**  
    You notice that some users are unable to access your application hosted on AWS.  
    a) List the steps you would take to troubleshoot the network issues from the user's side to the server.  
    b) How would you identify if the issue is related to DNS, firewall rules, or load balancer configuration?

---

#### **Section H: CI/CD Pipeline Networking**

15. **[Networking in CI/CD Pipelines]**  
    Your CI/CD pipeline often fails due to network issues when pulling Docker images or pushing code to a remote repository.  
    a) Explain how you would troubleshoot and resolve these network issues.  
    b) How would you optimize the network configuration to ensure reliable and fast builds in the pipeline?
