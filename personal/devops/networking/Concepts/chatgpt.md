### 1. **OSI and TCP/IP Models**
   - **OSI Model**: Understanding the layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) helps in troubleshooting network issues.
   - **TCP/IP Model**: Focus on the Internet layer (IP, routing) and the Transport layer (TCP, UDP).

### 2. **IP Addressing and Subnetting**
   - **IP Addresses**: Familiarity with IPv4 and IPv6, understanding of public vs. private IP addresses.
   - **Subnetting**: Ability to calculate subnet masks, determine subnets, and understand CIDR notation.

### 3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - Understanding how DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses.
   - Familiarity with DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT).

### 4. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - Understanding how DHCP assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
   - Knowledge of how DHCP works with static and dynamic IPs.

### 5. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
   - Understanding how NAT works in translating private IP addresses to a public IP address.
   - Types of NAT (Static, Dynamic, PAT).

### 6. **Firewalls and Security Groups**
   - **Firewalls**: Understanding firewall rules, inbound/outbound rules, and how to configure them.
   - **Security Groups**: Knowledge of cloud-specific security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups) and how they control access.

### 7. **Load Balancing**
   - Concepts of load balancing traffic across multiple servers.
   - Knowledge of different types of load balancers (Layer 4 vs. Layer 7, hardware vs. software).

### 8. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
   - Understanding how VPNs work for secure communication over public networks.
   - Familiarity with protocols like IPsec, SSL/TLS.

### 9. **HTTP/HTTPS**
   - Understanding the basics of HTTP/HTTPS, status codes, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - Knowledge of SSL/TLS for securing HTTP traffic.

### 10. **SSH (Secure Shell)**
   - Understanding SSH for secure remote access to servers.
   - Knowledge of SSH keys, port forwarding, and tunneling.

### 11. **Proxy Servers**
   - Understanding how proxies work to forward client requests to another server.
   - Concepts of forward proxy, reverse proxy, and transparent proxy.

### 12. **Networking in Cloud Environments**
   - Familiarity with virtual networking concepts in cloud platforms (e.g., VPC in AWS, VNet in Azure).
   - Understanding cloud-specific networking services (e.g., AWS Route 53, Azure DNS, Google Cloud VPC).

### 13. **Containers and Networking**
   - Understanding networking in containerized environments (e.g., Docker networking).
   - Knowledge of network modes (bridge, host, overlay) in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

### 14. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Familiarity with tools for monitoring network traffic (e.g., Wireshark, Nagios).
   - Understanding how to set up and analyze network logs for troubleshooting.

### 15. **CI/CD Pipeline Networking**
   - Understanding how network configurations impact CI/CD pipelines.
   - Ensuring network security, speed, and reliability for automated deployments.
