JECA-2023  
(Booklet Number)  
Duration: 2 Hours    No. of MCQ : 100    Full Marks: 120  

INSTRUCTIONS  

1. All questions are of objective type having four answer options for each.  

2. Category-1 : Carries 1 mark each and only one option is correct. In case of incorrect answer or any combination of more than one answer, ¼ mark will be deducted.  

3. Category-2 : Carries 2 marks each and one or more option(s) is/are correct. If all correct answers are not marked and no incorrect answer is marked, then score = 2 × number of correct answers marked + actual number of correct answers. If any wrong option is marked or if any combination including a wrong option is marked, the answer will be considered wrong, but there is no negative marking for the same and zero mark will be awarded.  

4. Questions must be answered on OMR sheet by darkening the appropriate bubble marked A, B, C, or D.  

5. Use only Black/Blue ink ball point pen to mark the answer by filling up of the respective bubbles completely.  

6. Write question booklet number and your roll number carefully in the specified locations of the OMR Sheet. Also fill appropriate bubbles.  

7. Write your name (in block letters), name of the examination center and put your signature (as is appeared in Admit Card) in appropriate boxes in the OMR Sheet.  

8. The OMR sheet is liable to become invalid if there is any mistake in filling the correct bubbles for question booklet number/roll number or if there is any discrepancy in the name/signature of the candidate, name of the examination center. The OMR Sheet may also become invalid due to folding or putting stray marks on it or any damage to it. The consequence of such invalidation due to incorrect marking or careless handling by the candidate will be the sole responsibility of candidate.  

9. Candidates are not allowed to carry any written or printed material, calculator, pen, log-table, wristwatch, any communication device like mobile phones, bluetooth device etc. inside the examination hall. Any candidate found with such prohibited items will be reported against and his/her candidature will be summarily cancelled.  

10. Rough work must be done on the question booklet itself. Additional blank pages are given in the question booklet for rough work.  

11. Hand over the OMR Sheet to the invigilator before leaving the Examination Hall.  

Signature of the Candidate : _____  
(as in Admit Card)  

Signature of the Invigilator : _____
