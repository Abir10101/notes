Okay, here's a question paper incorporating the key networking concepts, designed with a focus on practical implementation and problem-solving skills.

**DevOps Networking Assessment**

**Time: 2 hours**

**Instructions:**

* Answer all questions to the best of your ability.
* Provide clear explanations and justifications for your solutions where applicable.
* Partial credit may be awarded for demonstrating understanding even if the complete solution isn't reached.

**Section 1: Fundamentals**

1. **Scenario:** You're setting up a new VPC in your cloud provider. You need to create two subnets: one for public-facing web servers and one for private databases.

* **a)** Explain the purpose of subnetting in this context.
* **b)** Provide an example of how you would allocate IP addresses and configure subnet masks for these two subnets using CIDR notation.

2. **Troubleshooting:** You're experiencing intermittent network connectivity issues between two servers.

* **a)** List three common tools you would use to troubleshoot this problem.
* **b)** Explain how you would use one of these tools to diagnose the issue.

3. **Scenario:** You need to ensure high availability for a critical web application.

* **a)** Explain how you would implement load balancing in this scenario.
* **b)** Discuss the factors you would consider when choosing a load balancing algorithm.

**Section 2: Advanced**

4. **Scenario:** You're deploying a containerized application using Kubernetes.

* **a)** Explain how container networking works in Kubernetes.
* **b)** Discuss the challenges of managing network security in a containerized environment.

5. **Scenario:** You've detected a potential security breach in your network.

* **a)** Outline the steps you would take to investigate and contain the breach.
* **b)** Discuss how you would improve network security to prevent future incidents.

6. **Scenario:** You're tasked with optimizing network performance for a high-traffic application.

* **a)** Describe the techniques you would employ to reduce latency and improve throughput.
* **b)** Explain how you would monitor network performance to identify bottlenecks.

**Bonus Question:**

7. **Automation:** Write a short Ansible playbook to configure basic firewall rules on a group of servers.

**Evaluation:**

* Your answers will be assessed based on:
    * Accuracy and completeness of solutions.
    * Clarity of explanations and justifications.
    * Demonstration of practical understanding and problem-solving skills.
    * Effective use of relevant networking concepts and tools.

Remember, this question paper is designed to gauge your hands-on networking abilities in the context of DevOps. Good luck!

**Note:**

* The specific questions and scenarios can be adapted based on the exact technologies and tools used in your target DevOps environment.
* The focus should remain on evaluating practical skills and understanding of networking concepts rather than rote memorization of theory.

Please let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further assistance with the question paper!
