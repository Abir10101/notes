# Git Branch Management


## Introduction

A well-structured branch management flow is crucial for handling frequent releases and immediate hotfixes efficiently. This article outlines a comprehensive branch management flow designed for regular periodic releases alongside urgent hotfixes, ensuring that features and fixes are tested thoroughly before reaching the production environment. By adopting this flow, teams can enhance collaboration, reduce integration issues, and accelerate time to market.

## Types of Branches

### 1. Main Branches
- **`master` branch**: This is your production branch, and it should always be stable, containing the code that is currently live in Main.
- **`develop` branch**: This is your main development branch where all the features, enhancements, and non-critical bug fixes are merged first. This branch is live in Testing Server and Integrated testing is performed in every merge request.

### 2. Supporting Branches
- **Feature branches**: New features or enhancements.
    - Naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Bugfix branches**: Non-critical bug fixes.
    - Naming convention: `bugfix/<bug-name>`
- **Release branches**: Preparation for new releases.
    - Naming convention: `release/vX.X.X`
- **Hotfix branches**: Critical fixes for production.
    - Naming convention: `hotfix/<issue>`

## Workflow

### 1. Regular Release Cycle (Every 14 Days)

- **Feature Development**
  1. Developers create `feature` branches from `develop` for each new feature.
  2. After completion and local testing, developers will create a pull request to merge it back into `develop`. The branch is reviewed and then merged into `develop`.

- **Bug Fixes**
  1. Developers create `bugfix` branches from `develop` for each bugs.
  2. After completion and local testing, developers will create a pull request to merge it back into `develop`. The branch is reviewed and then merged into `develop`.

- **Release Workflow**
  1. Every 14 days, create a `release` branch from `develop`.
  2. Perform **Integrated testing** and any final tweaks on this branch.
  3. Once it's confirmed stable, merge `release` into `master` and deploy to production.
  4. Also, merge back into `develop` to ensure all changes are included in the next cycle.

### 2. Hotfixes (Immediate Release)

- **Hotfix Workflow**:
  1. When a critical issue is identified in production, developers create a `hotfix` branch directly from `master`.
  2. Fix the issue in the `hotfix` branch & test thoroughly.
  3. Merge the `hotfix` branch first into `master` and deploy immediately.
  4. Also merge `hotfix` into `develop` to ensure the fix is included in the ongoing development.

## Conclusion

Adopting a structured branch management flow, offers numerous advantages to any software development team. Implementing such a branch management strategy empowers teams to tackle frequent releases and the need for rapid responses to critical production issues. However, this strategy depends on specific needs and dynamics of the team and varies from company to company.
