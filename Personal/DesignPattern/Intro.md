# Introduction

- Design patterns are architectural patterns for creating classes and objects to increase extensibility and code reuse.
- Design patterns can be categorized based on the intent of the problem to solve.
	- <ins>Creational Pattern</ins>: Object creation mechanisms for decoupling and code reuse.
	- <ins>Structural Pattern</ins>: how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
	- <ins>Behavioural Pattern</ins>: how to do effective communication and assignment responsibilities between objects.
- **Design Principles:**
  - Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
  - Program to an interface, not an implementation.
  - Favor composition over inheritance.

## Creational Pattern
